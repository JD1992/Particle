# Particle
A spigot plugin to let users use cosmetic simple particles effects around them.

This plugin was used almost over a year by a german minecraft citybuild server.

## TODO
- Make more doc comments
- Refactor comments to only use english
- Move default values, messagehandler and confighandler functionality into seperate files
- Use Lombok for getters and setters
- Make command names configurable
- Make default language english 
- Make messages configurable (for example Mongohandler)
